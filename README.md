# This paper proposes a new approach to diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by combining brain scans and social responsiveness measurements.
  Existing methods for diagnosing ASD are time-consuming and subjective, highlighting the need for a more efficient and objective approach.
  This study utilizes a deep learning model with fMRI data and social responsiveness metrics to enhance ASD diagnosis.
  The authors analyze network topology to understand how brain connectivity differs between individuals with ASD and typically developing controls.
  A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on a large dataset of fMRI connectomes to classify ASD and typically developing controls.
  The model is also tasked with gender classification and differentiating between task-based and resting-state fMRI data.
  To address class imbalance within the dataset, the authors employ class-balancing techniques.
  An ensemble of multiple CNNs is used to achieve higher accuracy in ASD classification, gender classification, and task vs rest classification.
  To improve interpretability, the study utilizes class activation maps to identify important brain connections for ASD diagnosis.
  The CNN focuses on temporal and cerebellar connections, particularly the right caudate nucleus and paracentral sulcus, when differentiating between ASD and typically developing brains.
  This research demonstrates the potential of deep learning models to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of ASD diagnosis using neuroimaging data.
  Social responsiveness measurements are included alongside brain scans to provide a more comprehensive assessment of autism.
  The chosen brain scans are resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans.
  The study utilizes the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset for training and testing the model.
  The ABIDE dataset contains neuroimaging and phenotype data from over 1100 participants.
  Preprocessing steps include data augmentation and feature selection using the F-score method.
  K-fold cross-validation is employed to evaluate the performance and generalizability of the model.
  The model's performance is measured using accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity.
   Network topology analysis reveals a shift from small-world architecture towards a random network in ASD brains.
  This research offers valuable insights into the potential of deep learning for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.---
